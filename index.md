**Project Resilience**

Project Resilience aims to improve the organizational security of small human rights focused groups around the globe facing the highest risk. The project utilizes a community supported and generated framework that incorporates collaborative approaches to security and improving practices for long-term sustainability.

The objective is to provide civil society and small, nimble, and resource-constrained human rights focused organizations around the world with an organizational security assessment, roadmap, and an implementation strategy to improve their security based on their capacity and priorities as an organization. The roadmap is collaboratively developed and will include resources from the broader Internet Freedom community. As part of the project, there will be a targeted small grants pool to assist in supporting the implementation of recommendations from the assessment.
